                    <h3>Emulated Traffic Light System</h3>
                    <p>Designed and prototyped an autonomous Emulated Traffic Light System that integrates hardware timing circuits with embedded software control. 
                        The purpose of the project was to improve light timing and ordering for an everyday traffic system.</p>
                    <p>The project involved building a multi-stage logic circuit utilizing a timer to generate clock pulses, which were then sequenced through a 
                        decade counter to manage the Red, Yellow, and Green light transitions. To ensure high reliability and precise timing intervals, I performed 
                        extensive <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/resources/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html" target="_blank">LTSpice</a> 
                        simulations to verify frequency responses and pulse-width modulation behaviors. These simulations allowed me to optimize timing and 
                        reduce errors before creating the physical circuitry.</p>
                    <p>Along with the hardware aspect, the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> was what controlled all the signals and logic. 
                        I developed custom control logic in C to oversee system states and automate the durations of each cycle, ultimately resulting in a fully functional, 
                        breadboard circuit that mirrors real-world traffic signaling logic. Through the use of a button, I am able to emulate the logic of a crosswalk 
                        system additionally with the timers of each street on the intersection individually.</p>

                    <h3>Distributed Banking System</h3>
                    <p>I developed a Distributed Banking System in C++, designed to take in high quantities of data and requests. The project was created to handle complex, 
                        real-time data processing for the financial aspect of a 'supposed' bank system. By leveraging 
                        <a href="https://developerhelp.microchip.com/xwiki/bin/view/applications/tcp-ip/sockets-ports/" target="_blank">TCP/IP Sockets</a> and 
                        <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/posix-threads-in-os/" target="_blank">POSIX threads</a>, I implemented a scalable 
                        multi-threaded architecture that has the ability to manage simultaneous client and server side interactions whilst taking into account efficiency and 
                        CPU usage.</p>
                    <p>A core part of the project was the coding of a local network request channel, which I designed to simulate secure, multi-server transactions across an 
                        environment emulating real-world transactions. To optimize performance and speed, I integrated a thread pool that could handle asynchronous events 
                        using POSIX signals. This implementation ensured that the system didn't crash under high quantities of requests.</p>
                    <p>This project effectively bridged low-level systems programming with distributed systems logic, a high-level coding task, and provided a comprehensive 
                        simulation of real-world banking infrastructure; albeit very limited.</p>

                    <h3>TAMU Datathon</h3>
                    <p>I partook in the <a href="https://tamudatathon.com/" target="_blank">TAMU Datathon</a>, where I developed a sophisticated data processing algorithm to 
                        analyze and categorize complex hospital datasets, focusing on real-world healthcare metrics such as patient demographics, diseases, case urgency, mortality 
                        rates, etc. My objective was to create a unified system capable of sorting and integrating present medical records, as well as future incoming data in order 
                        to identify underlying clinical patterns and trends.</p>
                    <p>My coding language of choice was <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> for its accessible computation and sorting logic possibilities. 
                        I created an algorithm that prioritized and classified entries based on medical importance and disease severity, while accounting for age and time spent in-clinic. 
                        This involved implementing data structures to handle the wide range of information stored in a hospital, ranging from gender-specific health outcomes to death 
                        rate analysis. This ensured that newly added data was immediately added into the existing database framework with ease.</p>
                    <p>The resulting algorithm provided a scalable foundation for predictive healthcare analytics, demonstrating a valuable connection between systems programming 
                        and medical decision-making.</p>
